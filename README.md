Just walked out of Alarum and I’m feeling half like I just ran a marathon and half like I fell down a rabbit hole of confusing time. For a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that's supposed to be a thriller, it thrilled the pants off of my rational mind, but I'm left wrestling with it like an overgrown puzzle with missing pieces—possibly even the pieces from a completely different puzzle. You know, the kind you find at the bottom of a graveyard-scented rummage sale box.

What was with that opening scene? I mean, a cat in a trench coat—seriously? Was that supposed to be a metaphor? And don't even get me started on the main character. He looked like he lost a staring contest with his own excuses. Which was strangely... captivating? Like when you just cannot look away from a poorly rehearsed magic trick in the mall. You know it’s bad, but you’re entranced by the sheer audacity of it all.

> Yet, somehow, there was a weird kind of magic in the madness. Maybe it was the cinematography— the shots that swirled like vin ordinaire in a glass, leaving me wondering if I should be swirling along with it. It’s a bizarre feeling when a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 makes you question your own sanity, right?

There were moments though, right—where you felt it—like a flash of lightning illuminating a room full of forgotten emotions and childhood fears. Like when you’re looking in a broken mirror and can’t decide whether you recognize the reflection or don’t. The sound editing, by the way, resonated like a 𝘮𝘦𝘨𝘢phone in a 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺—sharp yet oddly discordant.

if (𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩Again == true) { return confuseUser; } else { return getLifeTogether; }

And oh man, the end. That plot twist! It came out of nowhere, like a rubber chicken at a royal banquet—completely unexpected and just bizarre enough to be interesting. I’m not even sure if the ending made sense, or if they just wanted to leave me waking up at 3 AM questioning my life choices, but here we are.

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Sure, if only to ponder how you ended up researching existential theories at 2 AM. And if anyone finds my brain, please return it to me. It’s about the size of a large walnut and currently melted all over aisle five.
